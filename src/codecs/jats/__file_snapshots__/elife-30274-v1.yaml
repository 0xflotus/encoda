  Replication Study: Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated
  c-Myc
description: >-
  As part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we published a
  Registered Report (Blum et al., 2015), that described how we intended to
  replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Transcriptional amplification
  in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc’ (Lin et al., 2012). Here we report the
  results. We found overexpression of c-Myc increased total levels of RNA in
  P493-6 Burkitt’s lymphoma cells; however, while the effect was in the same
  direction as the original study (Figure 3E; Lin et al., 2012), statistical
  significance and the size of the effect varied between the original study and
  the two different lots of serum tested in this replication. Digital gene
  expression analysis for a set of genes was also performed on P493-6 cells
  before and after c-Myc overexpression. Transcripts from genes that were active
  before c-Myc induction increased in expression following c-Myc overexpression,
  similar to the original study (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Transcripts from
  genes that were silent before c-Myc induction also increased in expression
  following c-Myc overexpression, while the original study concluded elevated
  c-Myc had no effect on silent genes (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Treating
  the data as paired, we found a statistically significant increase in gene
  expression for both active and silent genes upon c-Myc induction, with the
  change in gene expression greater for active genes compared to silent genes.
  Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.

        In 2012, Lin et al. reported results that the c-Myc transcription
        factor, a potent oncogene that is frequently overexpressed in a large
        percentage of cancers, globally amplifies the expression of actively
        transcribed genes, opposed to regulating specific target genes. Using

        begin to become detectable. Total RNA per 1,000 cells at 0 hr were much
        lower in this replication attempt than those reported in the original
        study, although changes in total RNA levels were in the same direction
        following c-Myc expression. Similarly, another independent study that
        measured total RNA from P493-6 cells reported a different level at 0 hr

        expression (

        ). This compares to the original study that identified 755 active genes
        with a median expression of 7.06, and 514 silent genes with a median
        expression of 0.00 (more than half the silent genes did not have a
        reported expression value). Active genes in the original study,
        increased 91% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 96% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 87% from 1
        hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction, corresponding to a 1.23, 2.45, and
        1.99 times increase in median expression, respectively. Silent genes in
        the original study, increased 23% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 29% from 0 hr to 24
        hr, and 30% from 1 hr to 24 hr, with the median expression unchanged
        among conditions. In addition, we further examined the extent of overlap
        of active and silent genes between the original study and this
        replication attempt. Of the 1212 genes that were interrogated in both
        studies, 88.8% (603/679) of the active genes we identified in serum lot
        one were also active in the original study (90.1% (612/679) for serum
        lot two). For silent genes, 96.4% (456/473) of the genes we identified
        as silent in serum lot one were common with the silent genes identified
        in the original study (95.8% (453/473) for serum lot two).

        To test whether active genes, as well as silent genes, increased
        expression during c-Myc induction we performed the confirmatory analysis
        as outlined in the Registered Report (
      - target: '#bib3'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ). This analysis differed from what was reported in the original study
        by analyzing the data as paired instead of unpaired. As suggested during
        peer review of the Registered Report, this is because expression of the
        same gene, analyzed across different conditions, is not independent (
      - target: '#bib3'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ). We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on active genes comparing
        expression at 0 hr to 1 hr, 0 hr to 24 hr, and 1 hr to 24 hr, which were
        statistically significant for cells grown in both lots of serum (

        ). The same comparisons were performed on silent genes, which were also
        statistically significant, with the exception of the silent gene
        comparison of 1 hr to 24 hr for serum lot one. Considering this was not
        the test reported in the original study, we conducted these paired
        analyses on the original data to provide a direct comparison. For both
        active and silent genes c-Myc induction resulted in statistically
        significant increases in expression, with the exception of the silent
        gene comparison from 0 hr to 1 hr (

        ). This is in contrast to the results of the unpaired tests that were
        reported in the original study where active genes were reported to have
        a statistically significant increase in expression and silent genes were
        reported as not statistically significant for all comparisons. We
        conducted an exploratory unpaired analysis on the replication data for
        comparison, which resulted in statistically significant differences
        among the active gene comparisons as well as half of the silent gene
        comparisons (

        Importantly, though, the question of whether the change in expression
        among active genes is different than silent genes has not been tested.
        This would require a separate test on their difference (

      - target: '#bib21'

        ). To test whether active genes increased in expression during c-Myc
        induction more than silent genes, we performed an exploratory analysis
        on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc induction
        (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in expression of
        silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr). For both
        the original and replication data, there was a statistically significant
        increase in expression of active genes compared to silent genes (

        ). This suggests that active genes and silent genes do not have similar
        rates of expression upon c-Myc induction. To summarize, for this
        experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the
        original study and suggest that while both active and silent genes
        increased in expression upon c-Myc induction, the rate of increase was
        different.

        The original study and this replication attempt used the same criteria
        to characterize a gene as silent or active, but there are many negative
        consequences of dichotomizing continuous variables, such as information
        loss, especially with a small gene set (
      - target: '#bib1'

      - '; '
      - target: '#bib4'

        ). Papers published after the original study took an unbiased view by
        collecting comprehensive RNA-sequencing data to assess if the
        transcriptional effects of c-Myc were direct or indirect, concluding
        c-Myc activates and represses transcription of discrete gene sets, which
        in turn leads to induced RNA amplification (

      - target: '#bib35'

        ). Furthermore, Sabò and colleagues also used NanoString technology to
        quantify a subset of the differentially expressed genes identified by
        RNA-seq and observed similar results that revealed upward shifts in gene
        expression upon c-Myc induction (
      - target: '#bib27'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ). However, instead of dichotomizing genes as active or silent, gene
        expression data was presented as continuous. Similarly, we presented the
        digital gene expression data generated during this replication attempt
        as continuous, which illustrates a general pattern of overall increased
        gene expression following c-Myc induction (

        ). Importantly, though, these results are limited to the 1369 genes
        interrogated in this study and may or may not reflect how the entire
        transcriptome of P493-6 cells respond to c-Myc induction.

        variability of the sample (e.g.

Additionally, the statistical tests reported in\_Figure\_3F of the original study incorrectly described the comparisons as between 0 hr and 1 hr instead of between 0 hr and 24 hr (scripts shared by original authors). The corrected values are described above for comparisons and used in the meta-analysis. Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed."
