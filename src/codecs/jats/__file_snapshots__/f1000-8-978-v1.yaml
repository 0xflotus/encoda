         suggests that dry-land regions are projected to significant climate changes, but there still exist substantial variability and uncertainty in these estimates based on different scenarios. Many of the important United Arab Emirates (UAE) plant species, for instance, may be facing major challenges for their survival. Many of such native species are becoming restricted in their distributions because of overgrazing and habitat destruction. In addition to the natural prolonged drought, human activities are also threatening many native plants

It commonly exists in India and Pakistan in large numbers. In the UAE it is found on the inland sand plains and low dunes of the Northern Emirates and eastern rim of Abu Dhabi emirate, and appears occasionally in wadi beds of the Hajar mountain range

        Arabian Peninsula. This species is known for delayed seed germination,
        which is due to the hard coat of its seeds, therefore lowering its
        ability to compete with other plants over resources. This tree has
        different importance to people and animals. The honey produced from its
        flowers is very valuable and its leaves has various medicinal uses. The
        leaves also contain various flavonoids, saponin, alkaloids, and
        allelochemicals.

        bioclimatic variables. To visualize the bioclimatic suitability range
        shift in the future projection, this study has used clamping module
        while running the model. Final outputs of the model predictions were
        exported to ArcGIS 10.1 for further analysis. The exported model outputs
        were converted to raster files and then the predicted habitat
        suitability ranges were reclassified using three pre-defined probability
        classes: high, medium and low. Other model settings were kept unmodified
        and the Jackknife method was used to assess the variable contribution to
        the habitat distribution. Model fit was assessed using the area under

         can resist heat and drought and its deep taproot provide an extraordinary regenerative potentials. This might be the reason for larger area distribution of this species in the UAE. Yet these species’ future habitat suitability areas are important for the country to incorporate in the conservation strategies under climate change. The areas predicted to be suitable can be considered for afforestation programs in the UAE. For all the three species, and with climate change impact, maximum habitat suitability predictions will be in the north-eastern parts of the UAE. It is important to highlight that one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change are dry land ecosystems

        The MaxEnt model provides useful information about species and their
        satiable habitats, which can be used as a basis in planning future
        conservation and afforestation programs. Additionally, the model is also
        efficient in predicting species distribution under different climate
        change scenarios. Conservation and afforestation programs considering
        the species and their suitable habitats, therefore, will not only be
        easily manageable and sustainable but also economically efficient by
        using different SDMs. Finer spatial scales of species distribution
        modeling may be an appropriate next step toward species conservation
        under the potential changes in climatic conditions.
