  The Influence of Fisher Knowledge on the Susceptibility of Reef Fish
  Aggregations to Fishing
description:

      - >-
        Reef fishes that exhibit predictable aggregating behaviour are often
        considered vulnerable to overexploitation. However, fisher knowledge of
        this behaviour is often heterogeneous and, coupled with socioeconomic
        factors that constrain demand for or access to aggregated fish, will
        influence susceptibility to fishing. At two case study locations in
        Papua New Guinea, Ahus and Karkar islands, we conducted interview-based
        surveys to examine how local context influenced heterogeneity in
        knowledge of fish aggregations. We then explored the role of fisher
        knowledge in conferring susceptibility to fishing relative to
        socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort. Local heterogeneity in
        knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed between our case studies. At
        Ahus, variable access rights among fishers and genders to the main
        habitats were sources of heterogeneity in knowledge. By contrast,
        knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the sole source of variation
        was gear type. Differences between locations in the susceptibility of
        aggregations to fishing depended primarily on socioeconomic drivers of
        fishing effort rather than catchability. While Ahus fishers were
        knowledgeable of fish aggregations and used more selective gears, Karkar
        fishers were less constrained by tenure in their access to aggregation
        habitat. However, fishing effort was greater at Ahus and likely related
        to high dependency on fishing, greater access to provincial capital
        markets than Karkar and a weakening of customary management. Moreover,
        highly efficient fishing techniques have emerged at Ahus to exploit the
        non-reproductive aggregating behaviour of target species. Understanding
        how knowledge is structured within fishing communities and its relation
        to socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort is important if customary
        practices for conservation, such as

        . As changes to these key socioeconomic drivers increase demand for
        resources, reef fishes with slow life histories, such as groupers

        of fishers to locate and exploit fish populations when they are most
        vulnerable to fishing. Vulnerability to fishing increases when fish
        aggregate or school and the history of fishing is marked by developments

        The exploitation of reef fish spawning aggregations is an obvious
        example of fishers utilising knowledge on fish behaviour to target
        populations when their density has increased. A large number of
        important food fishes on coral reefs aggregate periodically at high
        density to spawn

        deconstruct the biological attributes of this behaviour and consider
        their effects on fisher memory. The biological attributes of aggregation
        behaviour can be categorised by their temporal, spatial and physical
        manifestations. Firstly, aggregation formation aligning with diurnal,
        lunar and seasonal periods is likely to promote recall since coral reef
        fishers often allocate effort according to such schedules 
      - target: '#pone.0091296-Aswani2'

      - target: '#pone.0091296-Aswani1'

        . However, some species are more mobile and therefore less predictable
        in space than others when aggregated for spawning (e.g. Carangidae) 
      - target: '#pone.0091296-Heyman1'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        . Lastly, the size of aggregations formed is expected to influence
        recall since memory varies according to how pleasurable, unusual or
        emotive an experience is 
      - target: '#pone.0091296-Matlin1'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        , while the presence of eggs or milt (i.e. spawning) are physical
        manifestations of behaviour that enable fishers to reconcile aggregation
        formation with biological function. In combination, these attributes are
        expected to influence the extent to which fishers develop knowledge on
        aggregations and perceive them as predictable.

        the capacity of a stock to recover rapidly following depletion, while
        susceptibility is the potential for the stock to be impacted by the

        . Thus, a population's susceptibility to aggregation fishing will be
        governed by catchability that, among other factors, relates to the

        , and fisher knowledge of their dynamics should be considered a critical
        component of susceptibility to fishing. Fisher knowledge will
        effectively act as the basis for the development of an aggregation-based
        fishery, the trajectory of which is subsequently affected by
        catchability attributes and socioeconomic drivers.

        In this study, we aimed to examine how fisher knowledge of reproductive
        and non-reproductive aggregations influences the susceptibility of
        populations to fishing at two case study sites in Papua New Guinea. The
        specific research questions were: (1) to what extent are fishers
        knowledgeable of aggregations and do they perceive them as predictable?;
        (2) how does variation in fisher knowledge of aggregations relate to
        local socioeconomic indicators?, and (3), what is the influence of
        fisher knowledge in conferring susceptibility to fishing relative to
        catchability and socioeconomic drivers of fishing pressure.

        line, net and spears. Fishing effort at Ahus primarily comprises use of
        lines and spearguns (97%, of total fishing effort), whereas effort at
        Karkar comprises both of these gears (72%) in combination with hand
        spearing (24%). By comparison, a small proportion (<4%) of fishing

        Interviews were conducted with fishers at Ahus (n = 16) and Karkar
        (Muluk: n = 7; Wadau: n = 9) in October 2012 to quantify fisher
        knowledge on aggregating behaviour and to develop an index of knowledge
        pertaining to fisher perceptions of aggregation predictability. At
        Karkar, interviews were conducted with all fishers for whom fishing was
        a regular livelihood activity. In Ahus, where the proportion of
        residents engaged in fishing was high by comparison, a sample of
        fishers, representative of fisher gender, clan membership and gear use,
        was taken. After pilot studies (n = 4) with Karkar fishers, a
        semi-structured questionnaire was designed to investigate fisher
        knowledge of the form, function and predictability of aggregating
        behaviour for six species of reef fish common to fisheries in both
        locations. The six species comprised two groupers (

    title: Evidence on aggregating behaviour of study species.

        Firstly, species recognition by fishers was established using a
        combination of pictures (landed specimens) and local names specific to
        location. Secondly, we asked fishers whether they caught each species
        frequently, infrequently or not at all and, if they encountered the
        species, to estimate the ‘poor’, ‘normal’ and ‘good’ catch rates
        (fish.trip
      - type: Superscript
        content:
          - −1
      - >-
        ) that they typically obtain for each species when using their primary
        gear. Thirdly, fishers were questioned on their knowledge of aggregating
        behaviour, initially focusing on whether they observe a species to
        display solitary, shoaling (groups of three or more fish displaying
        unsynchronised swimming) and schooling (groups of three or more fish
        displaying synchronised swimming) behaviour

      - >-
        . Fishers could assign multiple behavioural types to each species,
        giving eight potential categories including a ‘don't know’ response. For
        example, a species could be identified as solitary and shoaling, or as
        displaying all three behaviour types. Unless specified, ‘aggregation’
        refers to all forms (i.e. shoaling, schooling) and functions (e.g.
        resting) of social group behaviour.

        Seven attributes of the spatial, temporal and physical manifestations of
        aggregating behaviour were employed to quantify fisher knowledge of
        aggregations and their perceived predictability (
      - content:
          - Table 2
        target: '#pone-0091296-t002'
        relation: table
        type: Link
      - >-
        ). Aggregation attributes were discussed for each species and scored
        according to fisher responses. For some statistical tests and analyses (
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - see below
      - >-
        ), an index of fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was calculated
        for each fisher and species by summing the scores for the seven
        aggregation attributes (maximum score = 17; 
      - content:
          - Table 2
        target: '#pone-0091296-t002'
        relation: table
        type: Link
      - >-
        ). Thus, the fisher knowledge index essentially aims to measure the
        predictability of aggregations as perceived by fishers. For example, to
        obtain a maximum score, a fisher would need to recognise that
        aggregations form consistently at specific locations within a small home
        range, that formation aligns with diel, lunar and seasonal schedules,
        that aggregations are large (>500 fish), and that they form for spawning
        (
      - content:
          - Table 2
        target: '#pone-0091296-t002'
        relation: table
        type: Link
      - >-
        ). Aggregation size and spawning (presence of eggs or milt) are physical
        manifestations of behaviour that were assumed to promote recall and
        therefore perceived predictability. Since some species were reported as
        constantly shoaling or schooling, questions on periodicities of
        aggregation formation were obviously irrelevant. Therefore, fishers were
        asked as to whether aggregation size in frequently shoaling or schooling
        species (e.g. 
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - L. gibbus
      - ) increased with spawning.

        To investigate sources of variation in fisher knowledge within case
        study locations, data relating to socioeconomic indicators were
        collected during interviews. Indicators were selected based on
        literature pertaining to sources of variation in knowledge among coral
        reef fishers and included gender, dependency on fishing as a livelihood,
        and access rights to major reef habitats and gear types (

        that a specific gear will encounter aggregated fish if sites are
        available to fishers. Fisher responses to the question on whether they
        catch the species frequently, infrequently or not at all were used as a
        measure of encounterability, assuming that the gears used by that fisher
        would be as efficient in catching the fish while aggregated. Thirdly, to
        measure selectivity, i.e. the potential of the gear to capture and
        retain species, we used fisher reports of catch rates (fish.trip

        ). The mean ‘good’ catch rate across fisher responses was taken on each
        gear used for a species, from which gear selectivity was ranked by order

        Karkar) plotted. Secondly, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare

        . To make comparisons between locations, the fisher knowledge index was
        averaged across fishers for each location and the same statistical
        method as that applied to individual aggregation attributes was used.
        For statistical tests of variation in both individual aggregation
        attributes and in the fisher knowledge index, comparisons were
        restricted to those fishers knowledgeable on the species and its
        behaviour (i.e. excluding fishers that do not catch the species).

        each case study as the two locations differ significantly in their
        socioeconomic conditions and the aim was to examine local sources of
        variation in fisher knowledge. Here, all fisher respondents for a
        location were included in the analysis (n = 16) since variation in
        knowledge was integral to the analysis. However, results for Ahus should
        be treated with caution since sample size relative to the number of
        indicator (factor) levels imposed limitations on the RDA. Access to
        habitat was not included in the RDA for Karkar since it did not vary
        among respondents.

        Estimates of productivity attributes were averaged to give a single
        productivity score per species. To assess the relative importance of
        catchability and socioeconomic drivers of fishing pressure for the six
        species, each susceptibility attribute was first scored for each fisher
        respondent individually and then averaged across fishers to give a
        single attribute score for each location. Within location, the
        susceptibility attributes were combined by averaging across two sets of
        attributes; (1) the full set of 10 susceptibility attributes, and (2)
        the four catchability attributes (

        ). Consequently, two bivariate PSA plots were produced for the 12 fish
        populations (six species per location), one for productivity and the
        full set of susceptibility attributes, and a second for productivity and
        using only the four catchability attributes (we only present the PSA
        plot for the full set of susceptibility attributes). From both of these
        PSA plots, overall vulnerability (or risk) was derived for each
        population at Ahus and Karkar by taking the Euclidean distance between
        the origin and population location in the bivariate space

        vulnerability (with species as paired samples and location as

        attribute set and for the catchability attributes. Exact significance

        socioeconomic attributes used in the PSA scored more highly for Ahus
        than Karkar (

        ). The score for fishing effort was higher at Ahus since fishers at that
        location averaged 93 hours of fishing each month compared to 58 hours at
        Karkar. Dependency on fishing was also higher, with more than 80% of
        fishers reporting fishing as their primary livelihood compared to 12.5%
        at Karkar. The majority of fishers at Ahus also reported that they use
        scare lines for catching snappers, ensuring that habitat impacts were
        also comparatively high at that location. Moreover, fishers from Ahus
        regularly accessed markets of neighbouring villages (neighbouring
        islands and the northern coast of Manus) and the provincial capital,
        whereas fishers from Karkar generally traded locally or occasionally in
        neighbouring villages on Karkar. Ownership rights and customary reef
        closure measures still existed at Karkar, but at Ahus fishers reported
        during interviews that the customary closure was no longer being
        respected or complied with. Consequently, including attributes relating
        to socioeconomic drivers resulted in a greater susceptibility of
        aggregations to fishing at Ahus compared to Karkar.

        , we found that fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour varied between
        our two case study communities. While this finding is unsurprising in a
        country of such high cultural and socioeconomic diversity, our study
        makes a contribution by also highlighting the influence of local context
        in structuring knowledge within communities. Thus, the relatively high
        heterogeneity in knowledge at Ahus related to rights of access among
        fishers and genders to the main habitats of the relatively large reef
        system. By contrast, knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the
        sole source of variation was primary gear type. Though knowledge of
        aggregation location and timing are prerequisites for exploitation,
        factors that drive fishing effort will ultimately determine their
        susceptibility to fishing since knowledge, by itself, does not ensure
        that fishers will seek to maximize their extraction from the fishery

        Fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was particularly heterogeneous
        at Ahus. Since variation at Ahus related to gender and access to reef
        habitats, it appears to stem from the decentralised tenure system that
        specifies ownership rights to space, species, gear and the techniques
        for using gears among kinship groups

        . An understanding of how knowledge is structured and maintained among
        kinship groups is important since the breakdown of customs and the
        spread of knowledge can lead to increased fishing pressure on
        aggregations

        . By contrast, marine tenure arrangements at Karkar allow for relatively

        type: Cite
      - >-
        . With less specialisation in specific gears or habitats, knowledge was
        less structured at Karkar compared to Ahus, as indicated by the
        relatively low amount of variation explained by the redundancy analysis.
        Heterogeneity in knowledge was unrelated to dependency on fishing, which
        at Ahus resulted from the fact that fishing was the primary livelihood
        for 80% of fishers, encompassing both genders and fishers with differing
        right of access. Though our objective was to explore local sources of
        variation in knowledge, dependency on fishing may explain why fishing
        effort was higher and fishers used more efficient gears (i.e. scare
        lines) at Ahus.

        Variation in fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed among
        the three families of reef fish. Compared to emperors and groupers,
        knowledge of aggregations of the two snappers was greater and relatively
        homogenous. Snapper aggregation locations were perceived by fishers as
        spatially predictable and were associated with particular features of

        Our study was a first step in quantitatively exploring the factors that
        influence local ecological knowledge of reef fish aggregating behaviour
        within communities, but was limited to a small number of socioeconomic
        indicators that reflect the contemporary context of the two communities.
        Consequently, we did not quantify important historical aspects of these
        communities and the role of oral histories in transferring knowledge,
        which may have influenced the patterns observed in our data. For
        example, though we pooled respondents from the two study villages of

        aggregations was higher (by 52%, based on the sum fisher knowledge index
        for both grouper species) among Muluk fishers than neighbouring fishers
        from Wadau. Since fishers exhibit similar dependency on fishing, this
        finding may reflect the differing historical context of two communities,

        assumed that if a species appeared in a fisher's catch, then the gears
        used by that fisher were equally likely to encounter the species in
        aggregations if conditions of availability were met. This may be
        justified if aggregations did not form at depths beyond those typically
        fished by the gear, which would presumably affect fishers using gears
        that are generally constrained to shallower water (i.e. spearguns and
        nets) than fishers using lines. Our measure of availability was coarse
        but necessary in a data-poor context with limited time for observations
        on the spatial distribution of fishing effort. The use of CPUE to
        estimate selectivity was also subject to uncertainty, given the numerous
        factors that affect this parameter, and essentially constituted a
        measure of gear efficiency for a species rather than selectivity

        . Further development of indicator-based frameworks for
        aggregation-based reef fisheries may improve on our methods for
        estimating susceptibility to fishing.

        An additional caveat in the use of indicator-based approaches is that
        they can be overly reductionist in attempting to simplify complex
        socio-ecological systems. Consequently, PSA can be combined with more
        detailed social, economic or ecological research to better understand
        the management implications of more complex interactions that indicators
        fail to capture. It is ideally applied as a participatory risk
        assessment tool for supporting communication, promoting understanding,
        building consensus and prioritizing actions as part of community-based
        management planning. In our application of this tool, five populations
        were identified to be at medium risk from aggregation fishing. However,
        a participatory application of PSA in the two communities may have
        yielded different results. For example, resource users could develop
        their own indicators or choose to weight indicators according to their
        own priorities

        To conclude, heterogeneity in fisher knowledge relating to reef fish
        aggregating behaviour will be influenced by social, economic and
        cultural factors that are specific to the local context. Understanding
