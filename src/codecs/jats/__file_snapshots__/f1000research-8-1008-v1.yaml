        PCN (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in DMSO at a

        The results of the present study showed that PCN does induce cell death

        . Similarly, other also demonstrated that PCN of

      - |2-
         plays an important role in the invasion of host cells by inducing neutrophil cell death

        PCN are imminent.
  - type: Paragraph

      - >-
        Further results of the present study demonstrated that anti-PCN IgY
        antibodies specific to PCN significantly reduce the ability of this
        virulence to induce Raji cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Whilst
        no previous studies showing prevention of PCN-induced cell death by
        antigen-specific IgY have yet been reported to our knowledge, the
        present results are supported by the fact that antigen-specific IgY
        antibodies did prevent 
                        
      - P. aeruginosa

      - P. aeruginosa
      - >-
        -specific IgY antibodies may inhibit cellular inflammatory responses
        induced by this pathogen. Antigen-specific IgY antibodies also
        stimulated 
                        
      - P. aeruginosa
      - |2-
         aggregation and increased human neutrophil phagocytic activities
                        
      - '20'

        . The exact mechanism by which antigen-specific IgY antibodies inhibited
        PCN-induced Raji cell death seen in the present study remains unclear,
        however. Our previous study indicated that PCN induced Raji cell death
        via a caspase 3-activation pathway
                        
      - '21'
      - >-
        . It seems plausible, therefore, that PCN-IgY antibody complexes may
        fail to activate Raji cell-derived caspase 3 and hence, inhibit cell
        death. However, more studies are required to delineate this speculation.

Furthermore, antigen-specific IgY antibodies were able to inhibit PCN-induced Raji cell death, suggesting that PCN-specific IgY antibodies may be protective against PCN-induced Raji cell death.'
