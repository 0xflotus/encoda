Cyanobacteria are being explored for direct conversion of solar energy and carbon dioxide into biofuels. For this, efficient cyanobacterial strains will need to be designed via metabolic engineering. This will require identification of target knockouts to channelize the flow of carbon toward the product of interest while minimizing deletions of essential genes. We propose “Gene Conservation Index” (GCI) as a quick measure to predict gene essentiality in cyanobacteria. GCI is based on phylogenetic profile of a gene constructed with a reduced dataset of cyanobacterial genomes. GCI is the percentage of organism clusters in which the query gene is present in the reduced dataset. Of the 750 genes deemed to be essential in the experimental study on '

        knockout studies as potentially lethal deletions, the non-essential but
        conserved set of genes could be interesting targets for metabolic
        engineering. Further, we identify clusters of co-evolving genes (CCG),
        which provide insights that may be useful in annotation. Principal
        component analysis (PCA) plots of the CCGs are demonstrated as data
        visualization tools that are complementary to the conventional heatmaps.
        Our dataset consists of phylogenetic profiles for 23,643 non-redundant
        cyanobacterial genes. We believe that the data and the analysis
        presented here will be a great resource to the scientific community
        interested in cyanobacteria.

        Cyanobacteria, a group of prokaryotes, are well known for their ability
        to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They survive in different niche
        environmental conditions ranging from seawater to deserts and greatly
        contribute to the global primary production [

        photosynthetically convert it to biomass makes cyanobacteria leading
        candidates in biofuel research. The nitrogen fixing variety of some
        cyanobacteria contribute significantly to the nitrogen cycle [

        Unlike the eukaryotic algae, cyanobacteria do not produce storage
        compounds that are commercially attractive. Therefore, there is

        Current methods of prediction of gene essentiality have certain
        limitations. For example, the metabolic modelling based methods are
        applicable only for the metabolic genes. The computational approaches
        used for predicting gene essentiality based on orthologs do not include
        all the cyanobacterial genera. In experimental methods, the experimental
        techniques become arduous, especially while considering multiple growth
        conditions. Further, it is difficult to simulate all experimental
        conditions that cyanobacteria may encounter in nature during evolution.
        This is true especially for real life stress conditions and selection
        pressures which decide gene essentiality. In this study, we present gene
        conservation index as a quick method to assess gene essentiality. Our
        dataset comprises of phylogenetic profiles for 23,643 non-redundant
        genes from cyanobacterial species of diverse genera. Apart from insights
        on gene essentiality, the data provides useful clues on co-evolution of
        genes that may be helpful in gene annotation.

        from partial domain matches. All proteins that satisfy these criteria
        are listed as hits and omitted from being considered as query sequences
        subsequently. A “1” in the profile indicates the presence of at least

        Over twenty-three thousand phylogenetic profiles were constructed by
        using non-redundant protein coding genes from cyanobacteria as query.
        The protein sequences were searched against 120 cyanobacterial genomes
        of diverse genera using BLASTP. The database of phylogenetic profiles
        created not only contains the query IDs but also the hit IDs and
        therefore can be searched by UniProt IDs / PATRIC IDs of proteins in any
        of the 120 microorganisms (

        sequentially with the result that only a small fraction of proteins
        result in profiles for organisms added in later stages (

        ). Since only 20 cyanobacteria species were used for profile creation,
        some of the protein coding genes from the other cyanobacteria may not be
        found in our database but that number is expected to be small. Also, the
        genes missing in our profiles are expected to be unique genes present
        only in a limited number of cyanobacteria.

Therefore, to remove redundancy, we clustered the cyanobacterial strains by using profiles of genes that are conserved in ≥ 10% but < 95% of the cyanobacterial genomes resulting in 73 clusters ('

        It was of interest to check for potential redundancy in the query
        protein sequences used in construction of profiles. To that end, we
        performed an all-against-all BLASTP search of the query sequences used
        in profiles formation and find that 1904 of the ~ 10
      - type: Superscript

      - ' pairs show E-value of ≤ 10'

        . This accounts for ~ 8% redundancy in our profiles. These potentially
        redundant sequence pairs formed separate profiles in our dataset as they
        did not satisfy the criteria of query coverage and score density. BLASTP
        hits may also result from partial domain matches that cannot be
        considered as a hit. Another potential reason for this to happen is that
        such protein pairs may actually be evolutionarily related with common
        function but may have undergone substantial evolutionary divergence. To
        test this hypothesis, we checked if (i) the profiles are mutually
        exclusive with high Hamming distance and (ii) the divergence of the two
        proteins correlates with the evolution of the organisms. To test mutual
        exclusivity, we computed modified Hamming distance of such pairs of
        profiles by ignoring the genomes where both genes are absent. This
        analysis shows that indeed a large fraction of the potentially redundant
        pairs are mutually exclusive. This can be visualized on the principle
        component analysis (PCA) plot (

        ). Further, a heatmap of the profiles shows that divergence of the two
        functionally similar proteins largely correlates with the evolution of
        the organisms (

          - Fig 3B

      - >-
        ). To exemplify, profiles with query UniProt Ids B1XMD2 and B7K1R1 are
        mutually exclusive. Both the proteins are involved in the catalysis of
        the second and third steps (cysteine ligation, (EC:6.3.2.5), and
        decarboxylation, (EC:4.1.1.36)) in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA)
        from pantothenate [

        ] (Strauss et al, 2001). Each query protein is present in evolutionarily
        related subset of organisms suggesting that the divergence of the
        protein sequences correlates with the evolution of the organism.
        Likewise profiles with query UniProt IDs B5VZS0 and Q3M4X1 both
        represent the

        that have diverged significantly in the subsets of organisms and are not
        merely paralogs.

        About 35% of all the query genes (8,280 profiles) are semi-conserved.
        These include genes involved in niche functions such as nitrogen
        fixation, defense response to viruses, response to stress conditions,
        etc. Although only semi-conserved at the level of cyanobacterial phylum,
        some of these genes are conserved in their respective clades and this
        needs to be examined further.

        About 61% of the query genes (14,370 profiles) are unique and present
        only in < 10% of the organism clusters. A large fraction of these
        proteins are not annotated. It is likely that these proteins are
        conserved only at species level performing a highly niche function.

            Twelve representative CCGs are shown in (A) PCA plot where principle
            component analysis (PCA) of all the semi-conserved profiles (genes)
            was performed to plot only the representative genes and (B) Heatmap.
            Genes of a cluster are color-coded in the two plots. Phylogenetic
            profiles of genes are clustered using hierarchical clustering with
            Hamming distance as the metric, average linkage and a cutoff of
            0.15. The representative phylogenetic profiles (genes) are then
            clustered again to depict their relatedness. Organism clusters in
            the heatmap are based on their genome profiles depicting their
            evolutionary relationships. In the heatmap, grey and black colors
            indicate presence and absence of the gene, respectively. Details of
            the clusters are as follows: Cluster 1: transposase enzymes, Cluster
            2: acetamidase/formamidase enzymes, Cluster 3: nitrogen fixation
            genes, Cluster 4: SH3 domain protein, Cluster 5: sodium symporter
            proteins, Cluster 6: phosphate ABC transporter proteins, Cluster 7:
            ATP synthase subunit enzymes, Cluster 8: hydrogenase enzymes,
            Cluster 9: CRISPR associated proteins, Cluster 10: TPR
            repeat-containing proteins, Cluster 11: gas vesicle proteins,
            Cluster 12: ABC transporter proteins.

        We present systematic analysis of phylogenetic profiles of
        cyanobacterial genes. Clustering of the organisms helps prepare a
        reduced dataset of genomes, which is an important step in the entire
        analysis. Further, we propose gene conservation index (GCI) as a ready
        measure to predict gene essentiality in the cyanobacterial phylum. A
        large majority of the conserved genes (this study) have been found to be
        essential (Rubin et al, 2015). The CCG, obtained upon clustering of the
        semi-conserved genes, provide useful clues on the function of
        unannotated genes. We also present useful ways of visualization of the
        data in the form of heatmap and principal component analysis (PCA). We
        believe that the data presented here would serve as a useful resource to
        the scientific community.
