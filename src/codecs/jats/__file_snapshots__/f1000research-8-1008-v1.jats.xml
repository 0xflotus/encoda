            <p>PCN (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Five Leghorn chickens aged 3 months were subcutaneously immunized with 500 μl of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 100 μg of PCN in the back of the neck. Two weeks later, a booster was given by injecting 500 μl incomplete Freund adjuvant containing 40 μg PCN as above and the same immunization regime was repeated two weeks later. Eggs were collected one week after the last immunization and IgY was isolated by using Pierce® Chicken IgY Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierche Biotechnology, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer. The presence of anti-PCN IgY antibodies was detected using the agarose gel precipitation test (AGPT) as previously reported

                </sup>. Therefore, efforts to inhibit excessive host cell damage induced by PCN are imminent.
            </p>
            <p>Further results of the present study demonstrated that anti-PCN IgY antibodies specific to PCN significantly reduce the ability of this virulence to induce Raji cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Whilst no previous studies showing prevention of PCN-induced cell death by antigen-specific IgY have yet been reported to our knowledge, the present results are supported by the fact that antigen-specific IgY antibodies did prevent 
                
                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in humans by both active and passive immunization

                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-specific IgY antibodies may inhibit cellular inflammatory responses induced by this pathogen. Antigen-specific IgY antibodies also stimulated 
                
                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> aggregation and increased human neutrophil phagocytic activities

                </sup>. The exact mechanism by which antigen-specific IgY antibodies inhibited PCN-induced Raji cell death seen in the present study remains unclear, however. Our previous study indicated that PCN induced Raji cell death via a caspase 3-activation pathway

                </sup>. It seems plausible, therefore, that PCN-IgY antibody complexes may fail to activate Raji cell-derived caspase 3 and hence, inhibit cell death. However, more studies are required to delineate this speculation.

                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection has been even more complicated by the presence of MDR 
                
                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and hence alternative supplemental treatment approaches have been put forward based upon its bacterial virulent factors, such as exotoxin, lipopolysaccharide, and flagellin

                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to delay initial infection and reduce both frequency of infection and development of chronic infection seem to be promising. Both passive and active immunization with antigen-specific IgY antibodies in humans resulted in inhibition of 
                
                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. For example, oral immunization with specific IgY antibodies in patients with cystic fibrosis led to the inhibition of

                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, PCN-specific IgY antibodies used as an immunotherapy alongside with the common antibiotic treatments for 
                
                <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection are highly possible.

            <p> In conclusion, the present study showed that eggs from PCN-immunized chickens contain substantial amount of IgY antibodies that recognize PCN. Furthermore, antigen-specific IgY antibodies were able to inhibit PCN-induced Raji cell death, suggesting that PCN-specific IgY antibodies may be protective against PCN-induced Raji cell death.</p>
