Here we identify the molecular mechanisms used by Dmp53 to regulate growth and proliferation in a non-autonomous manner. First, Dmp53-mediated transcriptional induction of Eiger, the fly orthologue of TNFα ligand, leads to the cell-autonomous activation of JNK. Second, two distinct signaling events downstream of the Eiger/JNK axis are induced in order to independently regulate tissue size and cell number in adjacent cell populations. Whereas expression of the hormone dILP8 acts systemically to reduce growth rates and tissue size of adjacent cell populations, the production of Reactive Oxygen Species—downstream of Eiger/JNK and as a consequence of apoptosis induction—acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to reduce proliferation rates. Our results unravel how local and systemic signals act concertedly within a tissue to coordinate growth and proliferation, thereby generating well-proportioned organs and functionally integrated adults.'

        Coordinated tissue growth is essential for the generation of
        functionally integrated organs during animal development, as well as for
        tissue homeostasis during adult life. Although a broad range of genes
        and pathways regulating growth has been uncovered, the exact mechanisms
        by which cells within the same tissue maintain tissue homeostasis by
        responding to stress in a coordinated manner are less understood.

        The p53 tumor suppressor regulates the mammalian cell stress response
        through direct transcriptional activation of specific target genes
        involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis [

        ]. Recently, several non-cell-autonomous functions of p53 have been
        reported to be relevant in tissue homeostasis, as well as in tumor
        suppression [

        ]. In this regard, the activation of p53 in stromal fibroblasts promotes
        an antitumor microenvironment by impairing the survival and spread of
        adjacent tumor cells [

        ] as a direct effector of Dmp53 mediating intra-organ growth. We
        demonstrate that Egr acts through its receptor Grindelwald (Grnd) and
        Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling to reduce the growth and
        proliferation rates of adjacent cell populations. The inactivation of
        Egr or JNK signaling in slow-growing cell populations disrupts the
        coordination of growth among adjacent tissue domains, resulting in
        unproportioned adult wings. We further demonstrate that the regulation
        of tissue growth and proliferation rates by Dmp53 can be uncoupled and
        independently regulated by two distinct mechanisms downstream of Egr-JNK
        signaling. Whereas dILP8 expression is required to coordinate
        intra-organ growth and final tissue size, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
        production downstream of Egr/JNK and as a consequence of apoptosis
        induction acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to regulate the
        proliferation rates of adjacent epithelial cells. Taken together, our
        results show how local mechanisms along with systemic responses act
        together to coordinate the growth and proliferation of different parts
        of an organ.

        molecules regulated by the Dmp53/Egr/JNK axis and acting during larval

        that they are independently regulated by two distinct molecular

        Dilp8 protein, which acts systemically to reduce growth in adjacent cell
        populations without affecting proliferation rates. On the other hand,
        ROS production downstream of Eiger/JNK acts locally to regulate the
        proliferation rates of adjacent epithelial cells. In this regard, we

        cell populations is required for both apoptotic and proliferative
        responses in unperturbed territories. Eiger-dependent JNK activation was
        restricted to slow-growing domains, and inhibition of Grnd-JNK signaling
        in the growth-depleted territory was sufficient to restore normal size
        in adjacent domains. Therefore, although Eiger can act as a soluble
        ligand and activate JNK signaling in distant cells under certain
        circumstances, the role of this protein in coordinating intra-organ
        growth seems to be restricted to the growth-depleted tissue and involves
        local JNK activation.

        ]. Indeed, organ growth coordination in response to localized growth
        defects is mediated, at least in part, by reduced ecdysone levels [

        ]. Remarkably, the coordination of growth between adjacent wing disc
        compartments can be disrupted by exogenous feeding with
        20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) [
      - target: '#pgen.1008133.ref019'
        type: Cite

        ]. Therefore, Eiger/JNK-induced Dilp8 expression in the slow-growing
        compartment most likely regulates growth in a non-autonomous manner via
        modulation of ecdysone levels.

        A number of independent pathways have been shown to activate Dilp8
        expression upon several insults, including tissue damage, tissue
        regeneration, neoplastic growth and impaired ribosomal function [

        ]. While activation of the JNK and Hippo signaling pathways contributes
        to the induction of Dilp8 expression in neoplastic tumors, the JAK/STAT
        pathway drives the expression of this signaling molecule in regenerating
        tissues. Targeted depletion of ribosomal proteins in developing wing
        primordia activates Dilp8 expression through the transcription factor
        Xrp1, and the Xrp1-Dilp8 axis has been shown to have an impact on the
        growth rates of adjacent cell populations within the wing disc, as well
        on the growth rates of other primordia [
      - target: '#pgen.1008133.ref044'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Our data provide evidence of an Xrp1-independent and JNK-dependent
        mechanism by which Dilp8 expression is activated in growth-depleted
        territories. These results suggest that distinct signaling pathways,
        along with a combination of transcription factors, differentially
        regulate Dilp8 expression in function of the nature of the stress and
        the cellular context.

        In addition to their function in driving apoptosis, ROS also act as

        ]. In the first case, extracellular ROS generated by the NADPH oxidase
        Duox recruit hemocytes to the dying tissue. Hemocytes release Eiger,
        which promotes JNK activation in epithelial disc cells, thereby driving
        compensatory proliferation and hyperplastic tissue growth [
      - target: '#pgen.1008133.ref067'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. We found no evidence that hemocytes have a potential analogous role
        in coordinated intra-organ growth. Our results therefore strongly
        support the notion that ROS-dependent hemocyte recruitment is
        context-dependent and that it relies on sustained signals produced by
        dying cells. Following genetic or physical tissue damage, apoptotic
        cells generate a burst of ROS that propagates to the nearby surviving
        cells, thereby stimulating JNK signaling, which is required for cell
        proliferation and tissue repair [
      - target: '#pgen.1008133.ref051'
        type: Cite

        ]. Thus, whereas ROS-stimulated JNK activity promotes cell proliferation
        in the context of tissue regeneration, JNK-induced ROS reduce
        proliferation to adjust cell number in a non-cell autonomous manner.

        . After dissection of wing discs in cold PBS, the posterior GFP-positive
        compartment was separated under a fluorescence stereoscope and used for
        RNA extraction with Trizol. Library preparation and amplification were
        performed using Ovation RNA Amp System V" (Nugen;3100-60). Fragmentation
        and labelling were performed using Encode Biotin Module (Nugen;
        4200–60). The hybridization mixture was prepared following the
        Affymetrix protocol. Each sample was hybridized to a GeneChip

Microarray scanning and CEL fly generation were performed using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner GSC3000. To generate log2 expression estimates, overall array intensity was normalized between arrays and the probe intensity of all probes in a probe set was summarized to a single value using gcRMA (gcRMA 2.0.0; Bioconductor package). The transcriptional profile of RA-expressing and non-expressing cells of the posterior compartment was compared, and those genes with fold changes ≥ or ≤ 1 and p value ≤0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed.'
