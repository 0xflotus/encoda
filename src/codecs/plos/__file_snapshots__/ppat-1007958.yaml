        Productive HIV-1 infection requires the interaction with cellular
        co-factors at virtually all the steps of the viral replication cycle [

        ]. Viral entry depends on fusion of viral and cellular membranes through
        successive interactions with CD4 receptor combined with CXC chemokine
        receptor type 4 (CXCR4) or CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref002'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Once the core is released into the cytosol, the reverse transcriptase
        converts the viral RNA genome into a double-stranded copy DNA (cDNA) and
        the capsid (CA) uncoating process is initiated. HIV-1 cDNA gains access
        to the nucleus through the cellular nuclear transport machinery located
        at the nuclear pore, in the form of a pre-integration complex (PIC).
        These PICs consist of viral cDNA and other HIV-1 components like
        integrase (IN), matrix, nucleocapsid, CA and viral protein R (Vpr), as
        well as various host proteins, such as the high mobility group protein
        B1 (HMGB1), barrier to autointegration factor 1 (BAF1),
        lamina-associated polypeptide 2α (LAP2α) and lens-epithelium derived
        growth factor (LEDGF/p75) [

        ]. Several cellular import factors, including importin-7, importin-α3
        and Transportin 3 (TNPO3, also called TRN-SR2) have also been involved
        in HIV-1 nuclear import [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref008'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Apart from its implication in nuclear import of the viral PIC, it has
        been confirmed that N-terminal end of TNPO3 protein act as a direct
        binding partner of HIV-1 IN [

        ] that imports into the nucleus mostly serine/arginine (SR)-rich
        proteins. Within these proteins are essential pre-mRNA splicing factors
        such as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), SR-rich splicing
        factor 2 (SRSF2, also known as SC35) and cleavage and

        ]. The interaction between HIV-1 CA and CPSF6 impedes interferon
        (IFN)-mediated innate responses, allowing HIV-1 to escape from immune
        sensing and favouring infection. In fact, HIV-1 virions carrying CA
        mutation N74D that cannot interact with CPSF6 trigger innate sensors
        that induce an antiviral state against HIV-1 infection in macrophages [

        type: Cite

        life cycle along with other fundamental proteins such as CPSF6. However,
        its precise role during HIV-1 nuclear import and viral integration is
        not fully understood [

        HIV-1 infection remains incurable despite efficient antiretroviral
        treatments that tackle HIV-1 enzymes and proteins. One potential
        strategy to develop new therapeutic targets can be based on the study of
        the interaction between viral proteins and their cellular cofactors. In
        this regard, TNPO3 and other importins have been previously described as
        essential cellular proteins for HIV-1 infection [

        Of note, nuclear transport has not been widely studied as a potential
        target to HIV-1 infection and only recently new hits impeding TNPO3-IN

        ]. Besides this role in HIV-1 infection, TNPO3 is also linked to a rare
        muscular dystrophy termed LGMD1F. The genetic cause for LGMD1F was found
        to be an adenosine deletion in the stop codon of

        ]. The effect of this elongation for the functionality of TNPO3 protein
        is still unknown but previous data indicate that TNPO3_mut shows a
        perinuclear distribution whereas TNPO3_wt predominantly localizes inside
        the nucleus. This suggests that TNPO3 mutation could affect the
        subcellular localization of the protein [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref031'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Because the cargo-binding domain of TNPO3 resides in the C-terminal
        end, the additional 15 amino acids may also alter its cargo binding
        properties and subsequently influence alternative splicing [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref030'

        ]. Apart from these preliminary results, the mechanism by which TNPO3
        mutation affects its function and causes LGMD1F remains undetermined.
        Interestingly, other rare muscular diseases known as laminopathies are
        related to changes in the nuclear lamin architecture, a fibrous
        structure located below the nuclear membrane which functions include
        among others the regulation of the nuclear transport [

        ]. Besides, other muscle diseases like myotonic dystrophies are due to
        mutations in splicing factors. For these reasons the term
        “splicepathies” has been proposed to design these genetic diseases [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref048'

        ]. In summary, the biomedical interest of TNPO3 is first, as an
        essential cellular protein in the HIV-1 cycle and second through a
        specific mutation, as the genetic cause of the ultra-rare disease
        LGMD1F. In this context, we propose that the understanding of HIV-1
        biology in lymphocytes from LGMD1F patients represents a tool to get a
        better insight into the mechanisms of nuclear transport and to
        understand the pathogenic mechanisms leading to muscle disease such as
        muscular dystrophies that share common physiopathology pathways.

        ], the efficacy of infection is lower with N74D clone as compared to a
        wt virus, which explains lower luciferase levels. Interestingly,
        infection with N74D virus was not equal in the PBMCs of all LGMD1F
        patients as in some of them the infection with the mutant virus was
        higher than in controls, suggesting that PBMCs from some patients with
        LGMD1F can develop compensatory mechanism to overcome the deficiency in
        TNPO3-mediated transport. By unknown reasons, age of onset and severity
        of clinical symptoms are highly variable in LGMD1F patients, despite all

        ]. However despite the presence of 50% of the normal protein, high
        resistance to HIV-1 infection ex vivo was observed in these cells, with
        a reduction of more than 18-fold on average in the production of viral
        proteins. These results suggest that in patients with LGMD1F TNPO3_mut
        was interfering with the normal function of TNPO3_wt. It has been
        proposed that TNPO3 multimerizes in order to carry out its nuclear
        import functions [

        ]. If TNPO3_mut cannot multimerize or interferes with regular
        multimerization of TNPO3_wt, this could explain the severe restriction
        of viral infection observed in LGMD1F cells despite the co-dominant
        expression of both TNPO3_wt and TNPO3_mut.

        The cytosolic location of CPSF6 in lymphocytes from patients with LGMD1F
        confirms the functional impact of the mutated protein “in vivo” for the

        knockdown causes CPSF6 to accumulate in the cytoplasm [
      - target: '#ppat.1007958.ref012'
        type: Cite

        ]. Relocalization of CPSF6 to the cytosol could decrease its
        availability to bind to HIV-1 CA and contribute to the increased
        resistance to infection observed in LGMD1F patients.

        To confirm these data we generated HeLaP4 cell lines with stable
        knock-down of endogenous TNPO3 that were trans-complemented with either
        TNPO3_wt or TNPO3_mut form associated to LGMD1F. As described before,
        depletion of endogenous TNPO3 resulted in decreased viral infectivity
        that was recovered with the back-complementation of TNPO3_wt. However,
        expression of the TNPO3_mut form of the protein resulted in lower
        recovery of HIV-1 infection, which supports that the TNPO3_mut form
        found in LGMD1F patients restricts HIV-1 infection.

        differences between the cells of patients and controls in the formation
        of early and late reverse transcripts 5 hours after the infection. It

        into the nucleus cannot be concluded. However, integration was decreased
        more than 16-fold in PBMCs from LGMD1F patients in comparison to
        controls 5 days after infection suggesting an impairment of HIV-1
        integration due to the TNPO3 defect leading to deep impact on viral

        When using fluorescently labeled viruses (HIV-IN-eGFP), no differences
        were detected in the cellular distribution at 10 hours after infection.
        However at 24 hours post-infection the number of infected cells, as
        defined by IN-eGFP detection, was significantly decreased in patients
        with LGMD1F. Unexpectedly, only cytoplasmic complexes were reduced,
        suggesting a decreased stability of the complexes that was not a
        consequence of higher translocation to the nucleus, as there was no
        increase in the number of nuclear PICs. The change in subcellular
        distribution of CPSF6 could not explain this observation since an
        increase in CA stability due to cytosolic CPSF6 location after silencing
        TNPO3 has been proposed [

        ]. One potential hypothesis explaining this sharp decrease in cytosolic
        PIC numbers could be related to the induction of innate immune responses
        leading to CA degradation. It has been described that in macrophages
        HIV-1 evades innate immune recognition in macrophages through specific
        recruitment of cellular factors to the CA, including TNPO3 and CPSF6 to
        the CA [

        Finally, because integration targeting of the HIV-1 genome to silent or

        Our data confirm for the first time “in vitro” that adequate TNPO3
        function is essential for HIV-1 replication infection, but they also
        provide insights into the role of TNPO3 in LGMD1F. It should be noted
        that although LGMD1F patients show progressive muscle weakness as the
        disease advances, they do not show any type of immunodeficiency or
        higher susceptibility to infectious diseases. Therefore, the presence of

        patients showed similar resistance to HIV-1 infection, while there is a
        wide variability in the muscular clinical symptoms that affects these
        patients, although all of them share the same TNPO3 mutation. One
        possibility that merits further investigation is that TNPO3_mut could be
        affecting the nuclear import of essential factors for alternative

        depending on factors such as age of onset, rate of disease progression,
        distribution of muscle weakness and genetic causes. Such array of
        factors implies different steps of muscle development and neural and
        hormonal influences that can affect differently the highly complex
        pattern of muscle-specific transcripts processed by alternative splicing

        splicing of essential proteins for muscular contraction.

        In conclusion, TNPO3_mut protein expressed in LGMD1F cells is the second
        genetic defect leading to strong HIV-1 restriction in humans.
        Importantly, the first genetic defect shown to produce HIV-1
        restriction, the CCR5 delta32 deletion, blocks entry of R5-tropic but
        not X4- tropic strains.
