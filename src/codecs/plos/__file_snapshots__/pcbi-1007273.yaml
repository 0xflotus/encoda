        Genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genome
        sequence from significantly shorter sequencing reads. Most genome
        projects rely on whole genome shotgun sequencing which yields an
        oversampling of each genomic locus. Reads originating from the same
        locus are identified using assembly software, which can use these
        overlaps to reconstruct the genome sequence [

        reconstructions of the sequence are output as “unitigs” (or often
        “contigs”). Ambiguous reconstructions are output as edges linking
        unitigs. Scaffolding utilizes long-range linking information such as BAC

        distances on the chromosome, the resulting scaffolds can span entire
        chromosomes or chromosome arms.

        Hi-C is a sequencing-based assay originally designed to interrogate the
        3D structure of the genome inside a cell nucleus by measuring the
        contact frequency between all pairs of loci in the genome [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref015'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. The contact frequency between a pair of loci strongly correlates with
        the one-dimensional distance between them. Hi-C data can provide linkage
        information across a variety of length scales, spanning tens of
        megabases. As a result, Hi-C data can be used for genome scaffolding.
        Shortly after its introduction, Hi-C was used to generate
        chromosome-scale scaffolds [

        ] is an early method for Hi-C scaffolding that first clusters contigs
        into a user-specified number of chromosome groups and then orients and
        orders the contigs in each group independently to generate scaffolds.
        Thus, the scaffolds inherit any assembly errors present in the contigs.
        The original SALSA1 [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref021'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ] method first corrects the input assembly, using a lack of Hi-C
        coverage as evidence of error. It then orients and orders the corrected
        contigs to generate scaffolds. Recently, the 3D-DNA [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref020'

        There are several shortcomings common across currently available tools.
        They are sensitive to input assembly contiguity and Hi-C library
        variations and require tuning of parameters for each dataset. Inversions
        are common when the input contigs are short, as orientation is
        determined by maximizing the interaction frequency between contig ends
        across all possible orientations [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref016'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. When contigs are long, there are few interactions spanning the full
        length of the contigs, making the true orientation apparent from the
        higher weight of links. However, in the case of short contigs, there are
        interactions spanning the full length of the contig, making the true
        orientation have a similar weight to incorrect orientations. Biological
        factors, such as topologically associated domains (TADs), also confound
        this analysis [

        ] addressed some of these challenges, such as not requiring the expected
        number of chromosomes beforehand and correcting assemblies before
        scaffolding them with Hi-C data. We showed that SALSA1 worked better
        than the most widely used method, LACHESIS [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref016'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. However, SALSA1 often did not generate chromosome-sized scaffolds.
        The contiguity and correctness of the scaffolds depended on the coverage
        of Hi-C data and required manual data-dependent parameter tuning.
        Building on this work, SALSA2 does not require manual parameter tuning
        and is able to utilize all the contact information from the Hi-C data to
        generate near optimal sized scaffolds permitted by the data using a
        novel iterative scaffolding method. In addition to this, SALSA2 enables
        the use of an assembly graph to guide scaffolding, thereby minimizing
        errors, particularly orientation errors.

We also demonstrate its robustness to different Hi-C libraries with varying levels of intra-chromosomal contact frequencies. When compared to 3D-DNA, SALSA2 generates more accurate scaffolds across most conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first method to leverage assembly graph information for scaffolding Hi-C data.'

        ] representing the ambiguous reconstructions. Hi-C reads are aligned to
        the contig sequences, and contigs are optionally split in regions
        lacking Hi-C coverage. A hybrid scaffold graph is constructed using both
        ambiguous edges from the GFA and edges from the Hi-C reads, scoring
        edges according to a “best buddy” scheme. Scaffolds are iteratively
        constructed from this graph using a greedy weighted maximum matching. A
        mis-join detection step is performed after each iteration to check if
        any of the joins made during this round are incorrect. Incorrect joins
        are broken and the edges blacklisted during subsequent iterations. This
        process continues until the majority of joins made in the prior
        iteration are incorrect. This provides a natural stopping condition,
        when accurate Hi-C links have been exhausted. Below, we describe each of
        the steps in detail.

        Hi-C methods first crosslink a sample (cells or tissues) to preserve the
        genome conformation. The crosslinked DNA is then digested using multiple
        restriction enzymes (targeting in this case the restriction sites GATC
        and GANTC). The single-stranded 5’-overhangs are then filled in causing
        digested ends to be labeled with a biotinylated nucleotide. Next,
        spatially proximal digested ends of DNA are ligated, preserving both
        short- and long-range DNA contiguity. The DNA is then purified and
        sheared to a size appropriate for Illumina short-read sequencing. After
        shearing, the biotinylated fragments are enriched to assure that only
        fragments originating from ligation events are sequenced in paired-end
        mode via Illumina sequencers to inform DNA contiguity.

        As any assembly is likely to contain mis-assembled sequences, SALSA2
        uses the physical coverage of Hi-C pairs to identify suspicious regions
        and break the sequence at the likely point of mis-assembly. We define
        the physical coverage of a Hi-C read pair as the region on the contig
        spanned by the start of the leftmost fragment and the end of the
        rightmost fragment. A drop in physical coverage indicates a likely
        assembly error. In SALSA1, contigs are split when a fixed minimum
        coverage threshold is not met. A drawback of this approach is that
        coverage can vary, both due to sequencing depth and variation in Hi-C
        link density.

These intervals denote the regions of potential misassembly on the contig. Using the collection of these intervals as an interval graph, we find the maximal clique, which is the maximal set of intervals intersecting at any location along the contig.

The intuition behind choosing the smallest interval is to accurately pinpoint the location of assembly error. Note that this algorithm finds only one misassembly per contig. For more rigorous misassembly detection, same algorithm can be run multiple times on each contig until no more drops in physical coverage are found.'

        restriction enzyme cut sites in each contig. This normalization reduces
        the bias in the number of shared read pairs due to the contig length as
        the number of Hi-C reads sequenced from a particular region are

        We observed that the globally highest edge weight does not always
        capture the correct orientation and ordering information due to
        variations in Hi-C interaction frequencies within a genome. To address
        this, we defined a modified edge ratio, similar to the one described in

In a weighted maximum matching, a set of edges from a graph is chosen in such a way that they have no endpoints common and the sum of edge weights is maximized. In the case of scaffolding, a maximum weighted matching implies a layout of contigs, where no end can be used twice, that is maximally consistent with the data being used for scaffolding (Hi-C in our case). If we find the weighted maximum matching of the non-implicit edges (that is, edges between different contigs) in the graph, adding the implicit edges to this matching would yield a complete traversal. However, adding implicit edges to the matching can introduce a cycle. Such cycles are prevented by removing the lowest-weight non-implicit edge. Computing a maximal matching takes '

        Since the contig layout is greedy, it can introduce errors by selecting
        a false Hi-C link which was not eliminated by our ratio scoring. These
        errors propagate downstream, causing large chimeric scaffolds and
        chromosomal fusions. We examine each join made within all the scaffolds
        in the last iteration for correctness. Any join with low spanning Hi-C
        support relative to the rest of the scaffold is broken and the links are
        blacklisted for further iterations.

        eight assemblies. The assembly graph for each input was built by adding
        edges for any adjacent contigs in the genome. So the simulated assembly

        We simulated assembly error by randomly joining 200 pairs of contigs
        from each simulated assembly. All erroneous joins were made between
        contigs that were more than 10 Mbp apart or were assigned to different
        chromosomes in the reference. The remaining contigs were unaltered. We
        then aligned the Arima-HiC data and ran our assembly correction
        algorithm. When the algorithm marked a mis-join within 20 kbp of a true
        error we called it a true positive, otherwise we called it a false
        positive. Any unmarked error was called a false negative. The average
        sensitivity over all simulated assemblies was 77.62% and the specificity
        was 86.13%. The sensitivity was highest for larger contigs (50% for 200
        kbp versus more than 90% for contigs greater than 500 kbp,

        large contigs, which can have a negative impact on the final scaffolds

        sensitivity and specificity, most of the predicted locations of
        misassembly were within 5 kbp from the true misassembly location (

        joined 10 contigs and we generated 200 such erroneous scaffolds. The
        remaining contigs were correctly scaffolded (ten contigs per scaffold)
        based on their location in the reference. The average sensitivity was

        occurred near the ends of scaffolds and could be captured by decreasing
        the window size. Similar to assembly correction, we observed that
        sensitivity was highest with larger input contigs. Most of the misjoins
        missed by the algorithm were near the ends of scaffolds. The issue in
        detecting mis-assemblies in these regions is the low Hi-C physical
        coverage. Also, the other missed joins were between the small contigs
        which are hard to capture with Hi-C data alone. This evaluation
        highlights the accuracy of the mis-join detection algorithm to avoid
        over-scaffolding and provide a suitable stopping condition.

        We evaluated scaffolds across three categories of error: orientation,
        order, and chimera. An orientation error occurs whenever the orientation
        of a contig in a scaffold differs from that of the scaffold in the
        reference. An ordering error occurs when a set of three contigs adjacent
        in a scaffold have non-monotonic coordinates in the reference. A chimera
        error occurs when any pair of contigs adjacent in a scaffold align to
        different chromosomes in the reference. We broke the assembly at these
        errors and computed corrected scaffold lengths and NGA50 (analogous to
        the corrected NG50 metric defined by Salzberg et al. [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref038'

        ]). This statistic corrects for large but erroneous scaffolds which have
        an artificially high NG50. We did not include SALSA1 in the comparison
        because for small contig sizes (200 kbp to 500 kbp), none of the
        scaffolds contained more than 2 contigs. For larger sizes (600 kbp to
        900 kbp), the contiguity widely varied depending upon the minimum
        confidence parameter for accepting links between contigs.

        Hi-C scaffolding errors, particularly orientation errors, increased with
        decreasing assembly contiguity. We evaluated scaffolding methods across
        a variety of simulated contig sizes.

        ). For example, at 400 kbp, the orientation errors with the graph were
        comparable to the orientation errors of the graph-less approach at 900
        kbp. The NGA50 for SALSA2 also increased when assembly graph information
        was included (

        ). This highlights the power of the assembly graph to improve
        scaffolding and correct errors, especially on lower contiguity
        assemblies. This also indicates that generating a conservative assembly,
        rather than maximizing contiguity, can be preferable for input to Hi-C
        scaffolding. All the assemblies described in this paper are available
        online and can be found at

            As expected, the number of errors for all error types decrease with
            increasing input contig size. Incorporating the assembly graph
            reduces error across all categories and most assembly sizes, with
            the largest decrease seen in orientation errors. SALSA2 utilizing
            the graph has 2-4 fold fewer errors than 3D-DNA.

              filtered in advance. The NG50 of human reference GRCh38 is 145
              Mbp. The ratio between NG50 and NGA50 represents how many
              erroneous joins affect large scaffolds in the assembly. The bigger
              the difference between these values, the more aggressive the

        We also evaluated the ability of scaffolding short-read assemblies for
        both 3D-DNA and SALSA2. We did not include SALSA1 in this comparison
        because it is not designed to scaffold short-read assemblies. We
        observed that use of the assembly graph when scaffolding significantly
        reduced the number of orientation errors for SALSA2, increasing the
        scaffold NGA50 and largest chunk almost two-fold. When compared to
        3D-DNA without input assembly correction, SALSA2 with the assembly graph
        generates scaffolds of much higher NGA50 (7.99 Mbp vs. 1.00 Mbp). The
        number of scaffolding errors across all the categories was much lower in
        SALSA2 compared to 3D-DNA.

        We computed the CPU runtime and memory usage for both the methods while
        scaffolding long and short read assemblies with Arima-HiC data. We
        excluded the time required to map reads in both cases. While scaffolding
        the long-read assembly SALSA2 was 30-fold faster and required 3-fold
        less memory than 3D-DNA (11.44 CPU hours and 21.43 Gb peak memory versus
        3D-DNA with assembly correction at 318 CPU hours and 64.66 Gb peak
        memory). For the short-read assembly, the difference in runtime was even
        more pronounced. SALSA2 required 36.8 CPU hours and 61.8 Gb peak memory
        compared to 2980 CPU hours and 48.04 Gb peak memory needed by 3D-DNA
        without assembly correction. When run with assembly correction, 3D-DNA
        ran over 14 days on a 16-core machine without completing so we could not
        report any results.

        For mitotic Hi-C data, we observed that the 3D-DNA mis-assembly
        correction algorithm sheared the input assembly into small pieces, which
        resulted in more than 25,000 errors and more than half of the contigs
        incorrectly oriented or ordered. Without mis-assembly correction, the
        3D-DNA assembly has a higher number of orientation (250 vs. 81) and
        ordering (215 vs. 54) errors compared to SALSA2. The feature response
        curve for the 3D-DNA assembly with breaking is almost a diagonal (

        ) because the sheared contigs appeared to be randomly joined. SALSA2
        scaffolds contain longer stretches of correct scaffolds compared to
        3D-DNA with and without mis-assembly correction (

        contiguous.

        For the Chicago libraries, 3D-DNA without correction had the best NGA50
        and largest correct chunk. However, the scaffolds had more chimeric join
        errors than SALSA2. SALSA2 outperformed 3D-DNA in terms of NG50, NGA50,
        and longest chunk when 3D-DNA was run with assembly correction. 3D-DNA
        uses signatures of chromosome ends [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref020'

        ] to identify break positions which are not prominently present in
        Chicago data. As a result, it generated more chimeric joins compared to
        SALSA2. However, the number of order and orientation errors was similar
        across the methods. Since Chicago libraries do not provide
        chromosome-spanning contact information for scaffolding, the NG50 value
        for SALSA2 is 5.8 Mbp, comparable to the equivalent coverage assembly
        (50% L1+L2) in [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref043'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ] but much smaller than Hi-C libraries. Interestingly, SALSA1 was able
        to generate scaffolds of similar contiguity to SALSA2, which can be
        attributed to the lack of long range contact information in the library.
        SALSA2 is robust to changing contact distributions. In the case of
        Chicago data it produced a less contiguous assembly due to the shorter
        interaction distance. However, it avoids introducing false chromosome
        joins, unlike 3D-DNA, which appears tuned for a specific contact model.

        ]. This genome had high heterozygosity as the data was sequenced from a
        colony of mosquitoes rather than a single individual. Due to this, the
        assembly had a high duplication rate and was almost double the expected
        genome size. We scaffolded both the full assembly and the assembly after
        running purge haplotigs [

        ] using SALSA2 and 3D-DNA. For the post purge assembly, 3D-DNA generated
        an assembly with higher continuity but with more errors and a similar
        NA50 to SALSA2. (

        ) but was still very fragmented and much larger than the expected genome
        size. We conclude that heterozygous genome scaffolding remains a
        challenge and assemblies must either be de-duplicated beforehand or
        improved algorithms for scaffolding, such as [

        In this work, we present the first Hi-C scaffolding method that
        integrates an assembly graph to produce high-accuracy, chromosome-scale
        assemblies. Our experiments on both simulated and real sequencing data
        for the human genome demonstrate the benefits of using an assembly graph
        to guide scaffolding. We also show that SALSA2 outperforms alternative
        Hi-C scaffolding tools on assemblies of varied contiguity, using
        multiple Hi-C library preparations.
    type: Paragraph
  - content:

        SALSA2’s misassembly correction and scaffold misjoin validation can be
        improved in several ways. The current implementation does not detect a
        misjoin between two small contigs with high accuracy, mainly because
        Hi-C data does not have enough resolution to correct such errors. Also,
        we do not account for any GC bias correction when using the Hi-C
        coverage for detecting misjoins. Addressing these challenges in misjoin
        detection and misassembly correction is the immediate next step to
        improve the SALSA2 software.
    type: Paragraph

      - >-
        The human genome is relatively homozygous compared to many other
        species. Assembly of many species is further complicated by DNA input
        requirements which necessitates pooling multiple individuals. SALSA2
        does not remove duplication present in an input assembly and thus
        requires pre-processing by another tool, such as Purge Haplotigs [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref045'
        type: Cite
      - '] or haplomerger ['
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref047'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Once contigs are classified into the “primary” and “haplotig” sets,
        SALSA2 could be run on each of the sets independently.
    type: Paragraph
  - content:
      - >-
        Hi-C scaffolding has been historically prone to inversion errors when
        the input assembly is highly fragmented. The integration of the assembly
        graph with the scaffolding process can overcome this limitation.
        Orientation errors introduced in the assembly and scaffolding process
        can lead to incorrect identification of structural variations. On
        simulated data, more than 50% of errors were due to inversions, and
        integrating the assembly graph reduced these by as much as 3 to 4 fold.
        We did not observe as much improvement with the NA12878 test dataset
        because the contig NG50 was much higher than in the simulation. However,
        it is not always possible to assemble multi-megabase contigs. In such
        cases, the assembly graph is useful for limiting Hi-C errors.
    type: Paragraph
  - content:
      - >-
        Most existing Hi-C scaffolding methods also require an estimate for the
        number of chromosomes for a genome. This is implicitly taken to be the
        desired number of scaffolds to output. As demonstrated by the Chicago,
        mitotic, and replicate [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref048'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ] Hi-C libraries, the library as well as the genome influences the
        maximum correct scaffold size. It can be impractical to sweep over
        hundreds of chromosome values to select a “best” assembly. Since
        SALSA2’s mis-join correction algorithm stops scaffolding after the
        useful linking information in a dataset is exhausted, no chromosome
        count is needed as input.
    type: Paragraph

      - >-
        Obtaining the chromosome-scale picture of the genome is important and
        there is a trade-off between accuracy and continuity of the assembly.
        However, we believe that manual curation to remove assembly errors is an
        expensive and involved process that can often outpace the cost of the
        rest of the project. Most of the assembly projects using Hi-C data have
        had a significant curation effort to date [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref019'
        type: Cite

      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref049'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ]. Thus, we believe that not introducing errors in the first place is a
        better strategy to avoid the later burden of manual curation of small
        errors in chromosomes. The Hi-C data can be used with other independent
        technologies, such as optical mapping or linked-reads to reach accurate
        chromosome-scale scaffolds. 3D-DNA was recently updated to not require
        the chromosome count as input but the algorithm used has not been
        described. Interestingly, it no longer generates single-chromosome
        scaffolds in our experiments, a major claim in [
      - target: '#pcbi.1007273.ref020'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ], supporting a conservative scaffolding approach. Even while
        scaffolding short-read assemblies, we observed that SALSA2 generated
        more accurate scaffolds than 3D-DNA, indicating the utility of SALSA2 in
        scaffolding existing short-read assemblies of different genomes with the
        newly generated Hi-C data.

        tree of life, it may be impractical to generate physical or genetics
        maps for every organism. Thus, Hi-C sequencing combined with SALSA2
        presents an economical alternative for the reconstruction of
        chromosome-scale assemblies.

        aligning duplicated contigs to haploid reference makes it hard to define
