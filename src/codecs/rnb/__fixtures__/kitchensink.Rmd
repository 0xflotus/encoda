This is a test `Rmd` file intended as a comprehensive test of Encoda's `rnb` codec. It should have all the various components that one would expect in a R Notebook e.g. chunks that create plots, different chunk attributes, alternative meta data etc. When you edit and save this file, the actual test fixture, the `kitchensink.nb.html` file, gets saved.

# Inline chunks

Here is an inline chunk `r 2 * 3`. There could be more than one in a paragraph of course, `r sum(1, 2)`.

And some in another paragraph here `r 42` and here `r 43`.

## Heading level two

### Heading level three

# Block chunks

One string output:

```{r}
"Hello world"
```

A number and a string:

```{r}
print('Hi!')
1
```

A `data.frame`:

```{r}
head(cars)
```


An image:

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```
