        Most of the mammalian genome does not encode for working proteins.
        However, much of this non-coding DNA is still transcribed, often to
        produce RNA products that have a role in development. Some of these
        molecules are called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) because they contain
        more than 200 base pairs: these transcripts fine-tune gene expression by
        interacting with chromatin and the transcription machinery inside cells
        (

        In intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorders, defects in
        cognitive abilities, such as social interaction and communication, can
        appear early in development and persist into adulthood. These
        neurodevelopmental disorders involve abnormal changes in the way genetic
        information is expressed (
      - target: '#bib8'

        ). Several lncRNAs are associated with these conditions, sometimes being
        transcribed atypically (reviewed in

        Now, in eLife, Anand Srivastava, Marius Wernig, Howard Chang and
        colleagues – including Cheen Ang, Qing Ma and Orly Wapinski, all from
        Stanford University, as joint first authors – report that several
        lncRNAs that are involved in the formation of neurons are mutated or
        disrupted in children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual
        disabilities (

        Ang et al. started by reprogramming mouse cells called embryonic
        fibroblasts into neurons; this experiment helped them to identify 35
        candidate lncRNAs that are both upregulated when neurons form and close
        to neuronal genes. Amongst those, 28 were present on the same
        chromosomes in humans and in mice. The group then tried to identify
        whether these 28 human candidates were mutated in disease by overlapping
        the lncRNAs sequences onto a map of mutations found in children with
        neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital defects. This analysis
        highlighted five lncRNAs that were often mutated in affected
        individuals, and which happened to also be expressed during human brain
        development. One of them, called

        neurodevelopmental disorders. If so, this would strengthen the
        hypothesis that lncRNAs are independent transcriptional units that
        activate gene expression in the brain.

        accompany neurodevelopmental disorders, the results by Ang et al.
        suggest that lncRNAs themselves may contribute to these conditions, or
        that they drive the expression of disease-associated genes.

            Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (orange) were reprogrammed into neurons
            (top right) using transcription factors called BAM factors. This led
            to an increase in the expression of neuronal genes (green triangle)
            and lncRNAs (pink triangle). Of the 287 lncRNAs that were
            differentially expressed, 35 were close to neuronal genes. One of

        How mutations in protein-coding genes contribute to disease is widely
        studied, yet most mutations are found in regions that do not code for
        proteins. Understanding how lncRNAs regulate genes during brain
        development provides a way to tie genetic variation with changes in gene
        expression in neurodevelopmental disorders. Building on the findings by
        Ang et al., it may be possible to examine how clinical phenotypes,
        cellular responses and lncRNAs are connected in these conditions,
        potential unearthing new targets for therapeutic intervention.
